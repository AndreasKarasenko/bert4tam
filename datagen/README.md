## Synthetic data generation
As some researchers have shown (e.g. [Arora et al. 2024](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00222429241276529)) large language models can be used to replicate human user responses for quantitative and qualitative surveys. This allows for rapid survey development and more versatile studies.

For our paper we first asked 3 human experts to label our TAM constructs on a regular 5-point likert scale.
We then additionally asked ChatGPT-4o in a zero-shot manner to label the reviews as well.
This folder contains the codes for our experiments.
