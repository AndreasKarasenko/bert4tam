# Measuring technology acceptance over time using transfer models based on online customer reviews
## BERT4TAM

This respository accompanies the paper "Measuring technology acceptance over time using transfer models based on online customer reviews" in the Journal
of Retailing and Consumer Services.

Online customer reviews (OCRs) are user-generated, semi-formal evaluations of products, services, or technologies. They usually consist of a timestamp, a star rating and, in many cases, a natural language comment that reflects perceived strengths and weaknesses. OCRs are easily accessible in large numbers on the Internet â€“ for example, through app stores, electronic marketplaces, online shops, and review websites.
This paper presents new transfer models based on OCRs to measure acceptance. We train, test, and validate these transfer models using OCR samples and corresponding construct scores collected from expert raters or estimated from traditional surveys. From a management perspective, the new approach enhances former technology acceptance measurement because it enables a discussion of the evolution of acceptance over time.
